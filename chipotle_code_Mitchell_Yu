#Computer Speech HW Assignment
#When I started this homework assignment, I was sort of hangry. It explains the sloppiness of the code, but it also heavily influenced my desired end goal for this assignment. I guess I just really wanted to feel like I was ordering a burrito at Chipotle , so that's exactly what I coded here. I did not come up with any of the menu items, as they all came from the official Chipotle delivery website. Hopefully this code will satisfy any spontaneous burrito cravings that the user might have.

username = input("What's your name?\n")
print("\nGreetings "+username+"! Welcome to Chipotle!")
itemtype = input("What kind of menu item would you like today? Your options are: \n-Burrito \n-Burrito Bowl \n-Crispy Corn Tacos \n-Soft Flour Tacos\n")
print("\nThat's an excellent choice "+username+"!")
meat = input("What type of meat would you like in your "+itemtype+"? Your options are: \n-Steak \n-Carnitas \n-Chicken \n-Barbacoa \n-Sofritas\n")
print("\nGreat choice, "+meat+" is my favorite.")
rice = input("What type of rice would you like? Your options are: \n-Cilantro-Lime Brown Rice \n-Cilantro-Lime White Rice\n")
print("\n"+rice+" pairs fantastically with "+meat+"!")
bean = input("What type of beans or fajita veggies would you like? Your options are: \n-Black Beans \n-Pinto Beans \n-Fajita Veggies\n")
print("\nGreat choice!")
top1 = input("What toppings or extras would you like? Your options are: \n-Queso \n-Fresh Tomato Salsa \n-Tomatillo Red-Chili Salsa \n-Tomatillo Green-Chili Salsa \n-Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa \n-Sour Cream \n Guacamole (no extra charge!) \n-Romaine Lettuce \n-Monterey Jack Cheese\n")
top2 = input("\nSecond topping is on the house! What would you like as your second topping? Your options are: \n-Queso \n-Fresh Tomato Salsa \n-Tomatillo Red-Chili Salsa \n-Tomatillo Green-Chili Salsa \n-Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa \n-Sour Cream \n Guacamole (no extra charge!) \n-Romaine Lettuce \n-Monterey Jack Cheese\n")
chip = input("\nYour meal will come with a complimentary side of freshly fried chips! What would you like your dip to be? Your options are: \n-Queso \n-Salsa \n-Guacamole (no extra charge!)\n")
p = input("\nSo that's a "+itemtype+" with "+meat+", "+rice+", "+bean+", "+top1+", and "+top2+" with a side of chips and "+chip+"\nYour order total will be $15.42 including tax. {enter a numerical value for how much you will be paying}\n")
c=float(p)-15.42

print("\nYour change will be $"+d)
print("Thank you for coming to Chipotle and have a fantastic day!")
